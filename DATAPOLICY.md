# Data Policy

**"We"** refers to the DexScript team, consisting of DotZZ (dot_zz on Discord). This policy explains how DexScript interacts with your application’s data and files.

## Data Interaction

We do not collect, store, or access any data from your application. DexScript only interacts with your application’s data for functionality, and we do not have access to your bot's data, nor do we operate DexScript's commands.

## File Modifications

During the DexScript installation process, DexScript will modify your `ballsdex/core/bot.py` file.

DexScript will add a single line of code to allow the DexScript extension to load when your application starts. This modification is solely for the purpose of running DexScript. You can view the code added by checking the `DexScript/github/installer.py` file in the official DexScript GitHub repository.

## Contact Information

For any questions, comments, or concerns regarding this data policy, please contact DotZZ on Discord (dot_zz).
